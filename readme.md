## Introduction

The motion quartet is a visual illusion where four dots presented in a square configuration can be perceived as moving either horizontally or vertically, despite no actual motion. This experiment explores the bistable nature of this perception, where the interpretation can switch between horizontal and vertical movements.

## Features

- **Stimulus Presentation:** Code to present the motion quartet stimulus.
- **Data Collection:** Scripts to collect and save participant responses.
- **Analysis Tools:** Tools to analyze response data and visualize results.

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```sh

    cd motion-quartet-experiment
    ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**

    ```sh
    python -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate   # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`
    ```
